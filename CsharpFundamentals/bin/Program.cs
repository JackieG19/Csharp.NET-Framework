/*
Meaning of the Main Syntax:

static: It means Main Method can be called without an object.

public: It is access modifiers which means the compiler can execute this from anywhere.

void: The Main method doesnâ€™t return anything.

Main(): It is the configured name of the Main method.

String []args: For accepting the zero-indexed command line arguments. 
args is the user-defined name. So you can change it by a valid identifer. 
[] must come before the args otherwise compiler will give errors.
